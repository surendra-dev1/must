Hello World App Deployment Pipeline using GitHub Actions and Render
Welcome to the repository for deploying a "Hello World" app in Python using GitHub Actions and the Render platform. This project demonstrates the setup of a deployment pipeline without Docker, making it an accessible solution for deploying your application.

Application
The application in this repository is a basic "Hello World" app written in Python using Flask. The goal is to showcase the deployment pipeline and provide an example of how to deploy an application to Render without using Docker.

Deployment Pipeline
The deployment pipeline is configured using GitHub Actions workflows. The main steps of the pipeline include:

Build: The application code is checked out from the repository.

Deploy: The application code is deployed to the Render platform using a specified Render service.

Getting Started
To get started with deploying this "Hello World" app:

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the repository directory:

bash
Copy code
cd hello-world-deployment
Modify the application code in app.py as needed.

Commit and push your changes to the repository.

Usage
Create an account on the Render platform.

Create a new Render service and connect it to your GitHub repository.

Set up the required environment variables and secrets in your GitHub repository settings (e.g., RENDER_TOKEN).

Push changes to your repository. The GitHub Actions workflow will be triggered automatically, deploying the application to Render.
